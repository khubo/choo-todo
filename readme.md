# Choo.Js, ES6 and Webpack example app

I wanted to take the choo.js starter application (here: https://handbook.choo.io/your-first-choo-app/ ) and modify it to use the import/export syntax, and use it as part of my Webpack build system.

This is by no means a 'gold standard' project - but there should be enough here to get you going if you're serious about ES6, Webpack and Choo.Js

Files in the src folder will be processed on build and put into the public folder.

## Current Features:

* ES6 Import/Export and transpile with Babel
* Webpack Build System
* SCSS and PostCss
* JS Minification and Obfuscation
* Image handling in JS
